# Final-project-deep-learning
# Animal Classification

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to perform image classification on a dataset consisting of images of two different categories: car and motorcycle.

The ultimate goal is to develop deep learning models that can accurately determine the type of specific vehicles depicted in a given image.

The main goal of this project is to leverage deep learning techniques to build robust and accurate image classification models that are able to identify the number of vehicles.

## Dataset
This dataset contains 2,000 unique images of bikes and cars, covering a wide variety of types to challenge model classification.
It is unprocessed and not split into training and validation sets, allowing for custom augmentations. 
The aim is to distinguish between the two classes in a binary classification task.
